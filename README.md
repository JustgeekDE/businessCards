# Overview
This repository contains source files for my PCB business cards

There are currently 2 different types of cards:

## Power Supply
This is a small breakout board for a 7805 linear voltage regulator made solely from through-hole 
components.  
This board is mainly useful for people intereseted in learning more about electronics.

## Reference Card
This board contains a series of examples of silkscreen sizes, component footprints and various design considerations.  
The aim is to provide a useful size reference when design PCBs on a computer.

# Producing copies of the boards
The board files are available as [Cadsoft EAGLE](https://cadsoft.io/) files.

When creating your own copy, make sure to check all layers and replace the appropriate texts with your information.  
There are placeholders in the silkscreen, stopmask and copper layers that need to be replaced.

The boards are sized smaller than any common business card format, to allow them to fit into the common 5cm x 5cm bucket 
of affordable PCB production services. My personal favourite is [Dirty PCBs](http://dirtypcbs.com/) but any production 
service should be able to produce the boards.
